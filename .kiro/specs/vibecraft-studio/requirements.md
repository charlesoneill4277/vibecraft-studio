# VibeCraft Studio Requirements Document

## Introduction

VibeCraft Studio is a comprehensive modular platform that empowers non-coders to build professional web applications through organized, project-specific workspaces. The platform transforms chaotic "vibe coding" into an organized, professional development experience by providing project-based workspaces with AI-powered modules for planning, designing, building, and deploying web applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Project Management System

**User Story:** As a non-coder, I want to create and manage multiple isolated project workspaces, so that I can organize my different web development projects separately with their own context and resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new project THEN the system SHALL create an isolated workspace with project-specific data storage
2. WHEN a user accesses a project THEN the system SHALL load only that project's context, history, and resources
3. WHEN a user switches between projects THEN the system SHALL preserve the state of each project independently
4. WHEN a user views their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all their projects with status indicators and quick access
5. IF a user deletes a project THEN the system SHALL remove all associated data while preserving other projects

### Requirement 2: AI-Powered Prompt Management Center

**User Story:** As a non-coder, I want to have AI conversations with full memory and context within each project, so that I can build upon previous discussions and maintain continuity in my development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts a conversation in a project THEN the system SHALL maintain full chat history with context preservation
2. WHEN a user deletes specific messages THEN the system SHALL allow curation of conversation flow without losing other context
3. WHEN a user switches AI providers THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation continuity across different AI models
4. WHEN a user includes project knowledge THEN the system SHALL automatically inject relevant context into AI conversations
5. WHEN a user rates prompt effectiveness THEN the system SHALL track success metrics for project learning

### Requirement 3: Project-Specific Knowledge Repository

**User Story:** As a non-coder, I want to organize all my project documentation, assets, and research in one place, so that I can easily access and reference project-specific information during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads documents THEN the system SHALL organize them within the project's knowledge base
2. WHEN a user adds assets THEN the system SHALL provide a searchable library with categorization
3. WHEN a user searches knowledge base THEN the system SHALL provide AI-powered search across all project content
4. WHEN a user versions documents THEN the system SHALL track changes and maintain version history
5. WHEN a user references knowledge THEN the system SHALL automatically include relevant information in AI context

### Requirement 4: Codebase Integration System

**User Story:** As a non-coder, I want to connect my project to GitHub repositories or local folders, so that I can have AI assistance that understands my actual code structure and can provide contextual help.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects a GitHub repository THEN the system SHALL authenticate and provide file tree visualization
2. WHEN a user connects a local folder THEN the system SHALL access and monitor the local development environment
3. WHEN a user requests AI help THEN the system SHALL automatically include relevant code context in conversations
4. WHEN code changes occur THEN the system SHALL track changes and their relationship to AI prompts
5. WHEN a user works with branches THEN the system SHALL support different code versions and environments

### Requirement 5: User Authentication and Project Security

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure access to my projects with proper authentication, so that my project data and AI conversations remain private and protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs up THEN the system SHALL provide secure authentication with multiple provider options
2. WHEN a user accesses projects THEN the system SHALL enforce row-level security ensuring users only see their own data
3. WHEN a user stores API keys THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive credentials securely
4. WHEN a user collaborates THEN the system SHALL provide role-based access controls for team members
5. WHEN a user exports data THEN the system SHALL comply with GDPR requirements for data portability

### Requirement 6: Template and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a non-coder, I want access to reusable templates and resources across my projects, so that I can leverage proven patterns and accelerate my development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a project THEN the system SHALL offer relevant templates based on project type
2. WHEN a user saves a template THEN the system SHALL make it available across all their projects
3. WHEN a user shares templates THEN the system SHALL provide community template marketplace functionality
4. WHEN a user uses templates THEN the system SHALL track effectiveness and provide analytics
5. WHEN a user customizes templates THEN the system SHALL allow variable substitution and personalization

### Requirement 7: Multi-Provider AI Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use different AI providers within my projects, so that I can choose the best AI model for specific tasks and avoid vendor lock-in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user configures AI providers THEN the system SHALL support OpenAI, Anthropic, Straico, and other major providers
2. WHEN a user switches providers THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context across different AI models
3. WHEN a user tracks usage THEN the system SHALL provide analytics on AI costs and usage patterns
4. WHEN a user selects models THEN the system SHALL allow choosing specific models for different project needs
5. WHEN API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle rate limiting and provide alternatives

### Requirement 8: Real-time Collaboration Features

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to collaborate with others on projects in real-time, so that we can work together effectively on web development projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user invites team members THEN the system SHALL provide role-based access controls and permissions
2. WHEN team members make changes THEN the system SHALL provide real-time updates and change notifications
3. WHEN team members comment THEN the system SHALL support contextual feedback on prompts, designs, and code
4. WHEN conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide version control and conflict resolution mechanisms
5. WHEN team members collaborate THEN the system SHALL track contributions and provide team analytics

### Requirement 9: Project Analytics and Insights

**User Story:** As a user, I want insights into my project progress and development patterns, so that I can improve my development process and track project success.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views analytics THEN the system SHALL provide project health scoring and progress tracking
2. WHEN bottlenecks occur THEN the system SHALL detect and highlight areas where projects get stuck
3. WHEN patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL recognize successful project patterns and provide recommendations
4. WHEN resources are used THEN the system SHALL track time and AI usage across projects
5. WHEN projects complete THEN the system SHALL measure completion rates and quality metrics

### Requirement 10: Responsive Web Application

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access VibeCraft Studio from any device, so that I can work on my projects whether I'm on desktop, tablet, or mobile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the platform THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive interface that works on all screen sizes
2. WHEN a user navigates on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide touch-optimized interactions and navigation
