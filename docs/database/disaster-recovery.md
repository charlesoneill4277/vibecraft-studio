# Disaster Recovery Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the disaster recovery procedures for VibeCraft Studio's database and data infrastructure.

## Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)

- **RTO**: 4 hours (maximum downtime)
- **RPO**: 1 hour (maximum data loss)

## Backup Strategy

### Automated Backups

1. **Daily Backups**: Full database backup at 2 AM UTC
2. **Hourly Snapshots**: Point-in-time recovery snapshots
3. **Weekly Archives**: Long-term storage backups
4. **Real-time Replication**: Supabase built-in replication

### Backup Locations

- **Primary**: Supabase managed backups
- **Secondary**: Cloud storage (AWS S3/Google Cloud Storage)
- **Tertiary**: Local development backups for testing

## Disaster Scenarios and Recovery Procedures

### Scenario 1: Database Corruption

**Detection**: 
- Application errors
- Data integrity check failures
- User reports of missing/corrupted data

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Identify the scope of corruption
2. Stop all write operations
3. Restore from the latest clean backup
4. Verify data integrity
5. Resume operations
6. Investigate root cause

**Estimated Recovery Time**: 2-4 hours

### Scenario 2: Complete Database Loss

**Detection**:
- Database unavailable
- Connection timeouts
- Supabase service alerts

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Confirm database loss with Supabase support
2. Create new database instance
3. Restore schema from migration files
4. Restore data from latest backup
5. Update connection strings
6. Verify all services are operational
7. Communicate with users

**Estimated Recovery Time**: 4-6 hours

### Scenario 3: Data Center Outage

**Detection**:
- Regional service unavailability
- Multiple service failures
- Cloud provider status page alerts

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Activate secondary region (if configured)
2. Update DNS to point to backup region
3. Restore latest backup to new region
4. Verify application functionality
5. Monitor for issues
6. Plan return to primary region

**Estimated Recovery Time**: 2-8 hours

### Scenario 4: Accidental Data Deletion

**Detection**:
- User reports missing data
- Audit logs show deletion events
- Data validation checks fail

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Identify what was deleted and when
2. Stop further operations on affected data
3. Restore specific data from point-in-time backup
4. Verify restored data integrity
5. Implement additional safeguards
6. Document incident

**Estimated Recovery Time**: 1-3 hours

## Recovery Procedures

### 1. Database Schema Recovery

```bash
# Run migration system to restore schema
npm run db:migrate

# Verify schema integrity
npm run db:validate
```

### 2. Data Recovery from Backup

```typescript
import { backupManager } from '@/lib/supabase/backup'

// Restore from backup
await backupManager.restoreBackup(backupData)

// Verify data integrity
await backupManager.validateRestore()
```

### 3. Point-in-Time Recovery

```sql
-- Using Supabase CLI for point-in-time recovery
supabase db reset --linked
supabase db push --linked
```

### 4. User Data Recovery

```typescript
// Export specific user data
const userData = await backupManager.exportUserData(userId)

// Restore user data after recovery
await backupManager.restoreUserData(userId, userData)
```

## Testing and Validation

### Regular Testing Schedule

- **Monthly**: Full disaster recovery drill
- **Weekly**: Backup restoration test
- **Daily**: Backup verification
- **Continuous**: Data integrity monitoring

### Test Procedures

1. **Backup Restoration Test**
   - Create test environment
   - Restore from backup
   - Verify data completeness
   - Test application functionality

2. **Failover Test**
   - Simulate primary database failure
   - Execute failover procedures
   - Measure recovery time
   - Document issues and improvements

3. **Data Integrity Test**
   - Run integrity checks
   - Verify relationships
   - Check constraints
   - Validate business rules

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor

- Database availability
- Backup success/failure
- Replication lag
- Storage usage
- Query performance
- Error rates

### Alert Thresholds

- **Critical**: Database unavailable > 5 minutes
- **Warning**: Backup failure
- **Info**: High storage usage (>80%)

### Alert Channels

- Email notifications
- Slack alerts
- SMS for critical issues
- Dashboard monitoring

## Communication Plan

### Internal Communication

1. **Incident Commander**: Lead the recovery effort
2. **Technical Team**: Execute recovery procedures
3. **Management**: Provide updates and resources
4. **Support Team**: Handle user communications

### External Communication

1. **Status Page**: Update service status
2. **Email Notifications**: Inform affected users
3. **Social Media**: Provide updates if needed
4. **Support Channels**: Handle user inquiries
